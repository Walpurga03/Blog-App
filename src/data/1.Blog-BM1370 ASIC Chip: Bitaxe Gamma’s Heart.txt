Key Features of the BM1370 ASIC Chip

High Performance: The BM1370 ASIC chip is engineered to provide impressive hash rates, efficiency and of course: profitability. For example, in the Bitaxe 601 Gamma, the chip powers the miner to a hash rate of 1.20 TH/s, doubling the output of its predecessor, the Bitaxe Supra. This makes it one of the most efficient chips on the market in terms of both performance and energy consumption.
Power Efficiency: One of the standout features of the BM1370 chip is its 15 J/TH efficiency, which translates to just 15 joules per terahash. This metric represents the amount of energy required to process one trillion hashes. Compared to earlier ASIC chips, the BM1370 uses significantly less power for the same amount of work, a crucial factor in reducing operational costs for miners. This makes it an excellent choice for anyone looking to maximize their mining profitability while reducing their carbon footprint.
Advanced 7nm Process: The BM1370 ASIC chip is manufactured using the 7nm (nanometer) process, while it’s still a few years old process, it’s very good for home mining because. In fact, it can fit more transistors into a smaller space, which helps increase its efficiency. This advancement in chip architecture not only leads to better performance but also reduces the heat generated by the chip, further improving the cooling and overall reliability of the mining device.
Temperature Management: Even with its high hash rates, the BM1370 is designed with thermal efficiency in mind. It pairs well with advanced cooling solutions like the Argon THRML Cooler to handle overclocking scenarios, keeping the chip running at optimal temperatures while maintaining its hash rate and low noise levels.
Compact and Cost-Effective Design: The BM1370 is designed for both high performance and low power consumption, offering a compact size that allows it to be integrated into a variety of mining devices, including those with smaller form factors. This versatility ensures that miners of all sizes—from solo miners to large-scale mining farms—can benefit from the chip’s power.


Applications in SHA-256 Bitcoin Mining Devices
The BM1370 ASIC chip was designed for the Bitmain Antminer S21 Pro and then reutilized on the open source project Bitaxe 601, the Gamma, which basically uses the same chips of the S21 Pros. On the Bitaxe, the BM1370 provides a hash rate of up to 1.20 TH/s, which is an impressive hashrate per single chip, thanks to better optimization and overclocking compared to the standard Bitmain Antminer S21 Pro.


Bitaxe Gamma
Bitaxe Gamma: This miner, equipped with a single BM1370 chip, is at the 4th major revision of the Bitaxe Series, and offers solo miners the potential to contribute significantly to the Bitcoin network’s security. With its efficiency and performance, the Gamma is a great choice for miners who want to solo or pool mine while reducing energy consumption.

Bitmain Antminer S21Pro: The BM1370 is of course in the Bitmain’s Antminer S21Pro, an high-performance device aimed at providing miners with top-tier efficiency and hash rates. In these machines, the BM1370 delivers substantial performance boosts while helping to reduce the miner’s total power draw, making it a key player in large-scale mining operations.
Is the BM1370 ASIC Chip Worth It?

When you crunch the numbers, pooled mining often doesn’t add up. The smarter option is to go for solo mining on platforms like the CK Pool, Public Pool or other pools that support “lottery mining”. With an annual electricity cost of just a few dollars, you get to participate in the mining lottery every minute. As of now, each block reward stands at a minimum of $300,000 in BTC—a pretty nice jackpot!
The BM1370 is installed by default in the Bitaxe Gamma, the latest marvel of home solo/lottery mining, on an open source device that is revolutionizing and giving hope for a decentralized mining.

It’s definitely convenient getting one now, especially considering that prices have stabilized after the launch since a few months have passed. As Bitcoin mining becomes increasingly competitive and power-conscious, the BM1370 ASIC chip is leading the way for next-generation miners. Its 15 J/TH efficiency gives miners the ability to stay profitable even as mining difficulty increases, making it an attractive option for long-term investments.

The chip’s open-source potential thanks to the Bitaxe project also contributes to a growing community of developers and innovators. Mining hardware using the BM1370 on the Bitaxe can be easily customized, encouraging open-source collaboration to optimize performance, enhance firmware, and introduce new features to improve the mining experience. Of course, it’s worth noting that technological advancements are inevitable. While the BM1370 is a high-performance chip today, future competitors, such as Bitmain’s upcoming releases or Jack Dorsey’s new project with Core Scientific on a 3-nanometer (3nm) mining ASIC, could bring even more powerful solutions to market.

Conclusion
The BM1370 ASIC chip is a milestone in Bitcoin mining hardware, offering a balance of performance, energy efficiency, and compact design. Its adoption in devices like the Bitaxe Gamma and the Bitmain Antminer S21 Pro underscores its influence in the industry. Whether you’re a solo home miner or part of a larger operation, the BM1370 provides the tools needed to remain competitive in an ever-evolving industry. While the future may bring faster and more efficient chips, the BM1370 sets a strong benchmark for what Bitcoin miners should expect in terms of quality and performance.
